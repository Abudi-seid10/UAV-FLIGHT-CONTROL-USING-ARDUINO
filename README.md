## Introduction

The UAV Flight Control project aims to create a reliable and efficient flight control system using Arduino microcontrollers. The code includes components for sensor integration, PID control, motor control, and communication protocols.

## Features

- Integration with MPU6050 for gyroscopic and accelerometer data.
- PID control for stable flight and angle maintenance.
- Motor control using Electronic Speed Controllers (ESCs).
- Communication protocols for receiving control signals.
- Safety features such as arming and kill switches.

## Hardware Requirements

To run this code, you will need the following hardware components:

- Arduino Uno or similar microcontroller board.
- MPU6050 sensor for gyroscope and accelerometer data.
- Electronic Speed Controllers (ESCs) for motor control.
- Brushless DC (BLDC) motors suitable for UAV applications.
- Power supply and battery for the UAV.
- Transmitter and receiver for remote control (optional, depending on your setup).

## Software Requirements

Ensure you have the following software installed:

- Arduino IDE for compiling and uploading the code to the Arduino board.
- Necessary libraries for sensor integration and communication protocols (details provided in the code comments).
